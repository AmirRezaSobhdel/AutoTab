# AutoTab: An AutoML Python Library For Tabular Data

Working with tabular datasets in machine learning often presents challenges such as missing data, feature scaling, categorical encoding, outlier detection, and model selection. These steps are crucial but can be time-consuming and require domain expertise. This paper introduces AutoTab, a Python-based automated machine learning library designed to streamline the process of building classification and regression models for tabular datasets. AutoTab automates key aspects of data preprocessing, including imputation, normalization, feature encoding, and dimensionality reduction. Additionally, it provides model selection and hyperparameter optimization through a comparative experimentation framework that tests multiple algorithms and tuning strategies. AutoTab aims to balance automation with flexibility, offering users a customizable interface to fine-tune their machine learning pipelines. We evaluate the performance of AutoTab on multiple public datasets, demonstrating its ability to deliver accurate, efficient, and interpretable models with minimal user intervention. The proposed tool is designed to reduce the time and effort required for building machine learning models, making it accessible to both novice and experienced users alike.
